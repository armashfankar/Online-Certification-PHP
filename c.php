<h5><u><b>Pioneering computer scientist Dennis Ritchie.</b></u><br>Ritchie was better known as a co-creator of Unix, but he also invented the C programming language back in 1971.</font></h5></p>
<h5 class="tw_bullet">HISTROY</h5>
	<h5><font color="BLACK">
    * C language is a structure oriented programming language, was developed at Bell Laboratories in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie<BR>
    * C language features were derived from earlier language called “B” (Basic Combined Programming Language – BCPL)<BR>
    * C language was invented for implementing UNIX operating system<BR>
    * In 1978, Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan published the first edition  “The C Programming Language” and commonly known as K&R C<BR>
    * In 1983, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) established a committee to provide a modern, comprehensive definition of C. The resulting 	definition, the ANSI standard, or “ANSI C”, was completed late 1988.<BR>

<h5 class="tw_bullet">Uses of C language:</h5>
<h5><font color="BLACK">
	
		C language is used for developing system applications that forms major portion of operating systems such as Windows, UNIX and Linux. Below are some examples of C being used.
<BR><BR>
    * Database systems<BR>
    * Graphics packages<BR>
    * Word processors<BR>
    * Spread sheets<BR>
    * Operating system development<BR>
    * Compilers and Assemblers<BR>
    * Network drivers<BR>
    * Interpreters<BR>

<h5 class="tw_bullet">Key points to remember:</h5>
<h5><font color="BLACK"><br>
   1. C language is structured, middle level programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie<br>
   2. Operating system programs such as Windows, Unix, Linux are wriiten by C language<br>
   3. C89/C90 and C99 are two standardized editions of C language<br>
   4. C has been written in assembly language<br></FONT></h5></p>
