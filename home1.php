The Unix operating system and virtually all Unix applications are written in the C language. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons.</a></td>

<td><h5><center><font color="black">    *

      C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.<br>
    *

      C is a successor of B language which was introduced around 1970<br>
    *

      The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institue (ANSI).<br>
    *

      By 1973 UNIX OS almost totally written in C.<br>
    *

      Today C is the most widely used System Programming Language.<br>
    *

      Most of the state of the art software have been implemented using C<br>

<tr>
<td><h5><center>Why to use C ?</td>
<td><h5><center><font color="BLUE">C was initially used for system development work, in particular the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adoped as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be: </td>

<h4>HTML PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</H4>

<td><h5><center>Introducing HTML:</td>
<td><h5><center><font color="red">HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to write Web Pages. As its name suggests, HTML is a markup language.

    *

      Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together. When you click a link in a Web page, you are using hypertext.
    *

      Markup Language describes how HTML works. With a markup language, you simply "mark up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.

Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers.</a></td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td><h5><center>HTML Document Structure:</td>
<td><h5><center><font color="black">    An HTML document starts and ends with <html> and >/html> tags. These tags tell the browser that the entire document is composed in HTML. Inside these two tags, the document is split into two sections:

    <BR>*The <head>...</head> elements, which contain information about the document such as title of the document, author of the document etc. Information inside this tag does not display outside.
    <BR>*The <body>...</body> elements, which contain the real content of the document that you see on your screen.
<br>
</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td><h5><center>HTML is Forgiving?</td>
<td><h5><center><font color="BLUE">A very good quality associated with all the browsers is that they would not give any error if you have not put any HTML tag or attribute properly. They will just ignore that tag or attribute and will apply only correct tags and attributes before displaying the result.

We can not say, HTML is forgiving because this is just a markup language and required to format documents. </td>

<tr>
<td><h5><center>Introducing PHP:</td>
<td><h5><center><font color="red">PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved as more and more people found out how useful it was. Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first version of PHP way back in 1994.

    <br>* PHP is a recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".
    <br>* PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites.
    <br>* It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server.
    <br>* PHP is pleasingly zippy in its execution, especially when compiled as an Apache module on the Unix side. The MySQL server, once started, executes even very complex queries with huge result sets in record-setting time..</a></td>

<tr>
<td><h5><center>Common uses of PHP:</td>
<td><h5><center><font color="black">        <br>*PHP performs system functions, i.e. from files on a system it can create, open, read, write, and close them.
   <br> * PHP can handle forms, i.e. gather data from files, save data to a file, thru email you can send data, return data to the user.
    <br>* You add, delete, modify elements within your database thru PHP.
    <br>* Access cookies variables and set cookies.
    <br>* Using PHP, you can restrict users to access some pages of your website.
    <br>* It can encrypt data.
