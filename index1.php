                	<h2>Welcome to Technical Institute</h2>
                	<p>Diversification
The system of technical education at the under graduate level draws attributes like large, growing, varied, demanding and diverse. Because of enormous growth in engineering and technology, diverse fields of studies have grown and these attributes seem unrelated. But at the same time, stress is being laid to unify the diversities through the basic tools of analysis and synthesis. The Institute endeavors to create a synergy of the above attributes.

Computerization of Learning Process
As already mentioned, Computer is the central medium for the learning process viz,
♦ Visualization of concepts and processes through graphics and multimedia in multidimensional continuum,
♦ Analytical details under changing parameters and environment,
♦ Tutorial software for deeper understanding of the subject,
♦ Design exercise encompassing interdisciplinary knowledge, ♦ Self paced learning, ♦ Hands on experience for analysis, synthesis, simulation, troubleshooting and reliability under non-ideal, realistic and severe conditions which normally cannot be created without computers.

The Institute provides seamless opportunities for innovative learning.
